# CapsWord

When bound key is pressed results in a space.
When it is pressed with space results in CAPSWORD being activated and a space.

Stays on until CapsWord - off macro

I use Capsword on the left space and CapsWord - off on the right space

```
ifShift goTo 3
ifNotShift tapKey space
break
tapKey space
pressKey LS-
setReg 5 1
ifRegEq 5 1 goTo @0
#at the end of macro, the shift gets released automatically
```
